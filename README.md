This code is for the publication "Reversible Data Hiding in JPEG Images Using Quantized DC" in MDPI Entropy journal. You can find the paper at https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/21/9/835. 

Run main.m for an example. Full code including rest of the JPEG encoding (byte stuffing and JPEG header) will be uploaded at a later date.
